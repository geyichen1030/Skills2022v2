Task name: Manage Webservers through Ansible

Task Preparation:
First, I need to configurate VM environments. Then use handbook step by step.
Because the steps are too many to take screenshot, so I just take some of them. I show the yaml files and the final page, for the commands in terminal there are too many. if there are some mistakes in terminal, I cannot get the final result of web page. Conclusion: this task teaches me how to install apache server step by step, I know the basic step about installing. in the future I will to learn 2 parts, one is to install more complicating functions on apache and other is to optimize the web page.
