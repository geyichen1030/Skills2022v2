Task name: Manage Docker microservices

Task preparation: 
in this task I do it in linux vitual environment. the important thing is to upgrade docker to latest version,
otherwise, there will be some complicated problems.

Task implementation:
I find the handbook of docker and implement it.

Task troubleshooting:
The first time I use it I did not update the docker, because I use the latest ubuntu system, 
there are some problems with compatibility. after I update docker, all problems are fixed.
